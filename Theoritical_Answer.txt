1.c. Functional Interface : It is interface with only one abastract method. So a class that implement it
will havae in effect just one implemented function. It will be an object that acts like a function.
  eg.
   interface Comparator<T> {
	int compare(T o1, T o2);
}
The Comparator interface is a declarative wrapper for the function compare

Functor : An implementation of a functional interface is called a functor.  
Example:
public class EmployeeNameComparator implements Comparator<Employee> {
	@Override
	public int compare(Employee e1, Employee e2) {
		return e1.name.compareTo(e2.name);
	}
}
